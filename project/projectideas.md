### ideas


1. Add to Nate's Reminder app: we can also include the shuttle idea(3) for one of its features. Also, based on GPS data, like where your current location is, the notification comes up which containing the information of events that is held nearby that location. 
+ users can immediately send the information of events by using simple gesture.
+ especially Stevens events and shuttle

2. graphical restaurant reservation system 
- It allows users to see a graphical layout of restaurant's seats so that users can see what tables are available at what times and they can book a specific table.
- ** problem is I don't know how we will be able to get the restaurant's information and data for available seat  

3. Stevens social app
- I just like to make something for Stevens community lol
- it's like college version of Craigslist, but better design plz 
- We can basically combine everything on this app
  + bunch of informations related to Stevens
  + shuttle
  + events 
  + for sale between Stevens students
  + to search team member to work with for a project 
  + discussion forums for classes, jobs, school services, students, professor, etc 
  + Questions, like stack overflow, for each major
  + chat, social networking among Stevens students to be socialized 
  + ** problem is it might be too hard 
  + ** if it's too much, we can focus on one or two features 

4. App to meet up with friends using GPS

5. forums & chat for programmers at Stevens 

6. Search trending keywords 
- App to show real-time search trending keywords for each country, so we can see what is happening on each country. 
- in terms of database, I think it's impossible
